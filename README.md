# TNW Frontend Assignment

This project consists of creating a ticket panel component. For the ticket data, it connects to an external API endpoint.

Code has been adapted from the design taking in account certain particularities. Text from the APi was longer than provided design. This has been fixed and adapted using ellipsis, in some cases using an external library 'react-lines-ellipsis'.

To create the mobile ticket version, the library 'react-breakpoints' has been used.
Design has been adapted to the following breakpoints: 320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1200px, 1500px and 1920px.

## Tech used.

Relevant external libraries: `react-lines-ellipsis` and `react-breakpoints`
